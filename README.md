This application is a mobile app version of the Golden Sun Djinn Guide found at https://djinnguide.up.railway.app/

It is written in JacaScript using React Native. The application's state is saved to the device using Redux Persist and Async Storage.
Data is to be stored within the app itself, meaning internet access is not necessary for the application to function.

The application includes a handy checklist feature that allows users to mark which Djinn they have already collected.
